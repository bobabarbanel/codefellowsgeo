Several examples of maps on web pages using Leaflet.
1) Simple - shows markers and symbols and popups

2) Layers - adds layers with layer controls

3) Routes - uses MapQuest to draw routes from San Francisco to San Jose

4) Traffic - creates MapQuest traffic layer for San Francisco

5) GeoCode in sub-directory - starts an express server on port 8000; provides form for entering address
Then displays map for that address using MapQuest geocoding.
